music-player
============

A simple music player in python, includes what I think is a decent shuffle function.

Version 1.0: (Currently supports only .mp3)

    -- Save your audio files in the working directory (doesn't matter if other files are present as well)
    -- Run the program
  
Features:

    -- Will read all the files and parse out the mp3s.
    
    -- Will add all the mp3s to a list.
    
    -- Will shuffle the list enough so there is an illusion of randomness.
    
    -- Can assure you that the songs will not be played in the order that they're fed in to the list, so ideally it
       implements a shuffle function instead of shuffling every time.



To do: 

    -- Have an idea for avoiding recently played songs to be played again (Have to re-write the shuffle, the list will           play
       only once as of now)
    
    -- Save these customized lists (as suggested by a friend)
